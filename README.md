What the project does:

The Word Guess Game selects a random set of words with a Star Trek theme and allows the users to tyr to guess what the word is by typing on their keyboard. The user has 10 guesses before the lose the. 

Why the project is useful:

For myself, this project was very helpful to practice writing and debugging javascript. It's one thing to see and read javascript, but you don't really learn it until you just write it out. This was a frustating at times but I know that I learned a ton! 

Who maintains and contributes to the project:

So as of Saturday 12.22.18 at 8:40 PM I'm looing over my code and I realize that I could have written things out better. 
Becuase this is for class I'll have to ask to see when I'm allowed to update it.
